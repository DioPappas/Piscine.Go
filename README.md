Welcome to my **Piscine Go** repository! This repository contains all the exercises and projects I have completed as part of the Go language program on Zone01. The goal of this program is to build a solid foundation in Go programming by tackling various coding challenges, projects, and exercises. Through this experience, I have been able to learn and apply core concepts in Go programming.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find a collection of Go projects and exercises that cover a broad range of topics, from basic syntax and data types to more advanced concepts like concurrency and error handling. Each folder and file represents a different exercise or project that I have completed in my journey.

For the code repository, you can also visit my GitHub link: [Piscine.Go - GitHub](https://github.com/DioPappas/Piscine.Go).

## Topics Covered

Here’s an outline of the main topics and concepts I’ve explored so far:

1. **Basic Syntax and Data Types**
   - Introduction to Go's syntax and structure
   - Variables, constants, and data types
   - Basic operations and type conversions

2. **Control Structures**
   - Conditional statements (if, else, switch)
   - Looping (for, range, and loop control)

3. **Functions**
   - Defining and calling functions
   - Understanding parameters, return values, and scope
   - Using variadic functions

4. **Error Handling**
   - Error types and custom error handling
   - Working with error propagation

5. **Collections**
   - Arrays, slices, and maps
   - Manipulating collections and understanding memory management
   - Go-specific collection operations

6. **Structs and Methods**
   - Defining and using structs
   - Attaching methods to types
   - Basic OOP principles (encapsulation and method receivers)

7. **Pointers and Memory Management**
   - Pointer syntax and usage
   - Passing pointers to functions and modifying values
   - Memory allocation and management

8. **Concurrency in Go**
   - Introduction to goroutines and channels
   - Synchronization techniques (mutexes, wait groups)
   - Managing concurrent processes effectively

9. **File Handling and I/O**
   - Reading and writing files
   - Working with input/output operations in Go

10. **Standard Library Exploration**
    - Utilizing various packages in Go's standard library
    - Working with libraries for string manipulation, date/time, and more
